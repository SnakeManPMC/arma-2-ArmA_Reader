# arma-2-ArmA_Reader

ArmA 2 WRP (4WVR and 8WVR) file reader, displays some debug output

I guess this is some sort of DEBUG wrp reader which displays tons of debug text data on the screen.

For example it can cause huge slowdowns etc when displaying 500,000+ objects.

WRP_Stats should be more user friendly and "finished" wrp statistics util.
